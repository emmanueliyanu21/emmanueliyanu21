### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience looking to advance in this role. I am most at ease working with Angular and React however, I am open to working with other popular JavaScript-based languages (TypeScript, Next.js), open-source libs/frameworks, and learning new technologies (Ionic, React Native).

I prefer to work as part of a distributed team. The ideal project would be a diversified system built with various open-source tech stacks. A company with a clear vision for the coming years and a team of more senior individuals so that I can broaden my technical skillset.

I am open to remote, hybrid, and in-office roles.
