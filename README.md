### Hi there üëã

I am a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience looking to advance in this role. I am most at ease working with Angular, TypeScript, Next.js and React however, I am open to working with other popular JavaScript-based languages (Ionic, React Native), open-source libs/frameworks, and learning new technologies (Java, Node).

I prefer to work as part of a distributed team. The ideal project would be a diversified system built with various open-source tech stacks. A company with a clear vision for the coming years and a team of more senior individuals so that I can broaden my technical skillset.

I am open to remote, hybrid, and in-office roles.

üó≥Ô∏è Skills/Tech

React, Angular, MUI, AntD, TypeScript, GraphQL, Styled Components, Tailwind, Firebase, Prisma, Express, NextJS and Figma.

Jasmine, Jest, Testing Library, Playwright, Postman & Storybook.

Extreme Programming, Clean Code, CI/CD, TDD, Interviewing & Accessibility.

Writing RFCs, increasing bus factor, collaborating cross-teams.
